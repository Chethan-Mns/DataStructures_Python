# DataStructures_Python

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in Python. These data structures were practiced as part of my learning journey in the "Data Structures with Python" course on Udemy.

## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find Python implementations of fundamental data structures commonly used in computer science and software development. Each data structure is organized into its own module, making it easy to understand and use.

## Data Structures

Here are the data structures included in this repository:

- [Linked List](./LinkedList.py)
- [Stack](./Stack.py)
- [Queue](https://github.com/Chethan-Mns/DataStructures_Python/tree/main/Queue)
- [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/Chethan-Mns/DataStructures_Python/tree/main/BST)
- [Doubly Linked List](https://github.com/Chethan-Mns/DataStructures_Python/tree/main/Doubly%20Linked%20List)

Feel free to explore each data structure to learn more about their implementations.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this project by adding more data structures, improving existing implementations, or fixing issues, please feel free to submit pull requests. Contributions are welcome and appreciated!
